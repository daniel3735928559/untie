## Old Project

This project was found at an archeological digsite covering a
little-explored corner of my hard drive.  It is well past its
expiration date and in particular may no longer represent anyone's
opinion about best-practices for either coding or functionality.  It
is here because I still think the idea may have some value to someone,
but the activation energy required for restarting actual development
on this project is currently quite high.

## Synopsis

Untie is a bash tutorial.  It contains a decent amount of content,
both explanations and exercises, but was never completed.
