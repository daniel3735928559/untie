<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>This tutorial will work by providing you with some tasks to
accomplish and then walking you through the solutions step-by-step.
However, since doing anything at all on the command-line will require
some base-level skills, we'll start by explaining the first commands
and concepts you'll need to start on the tasks.  This is covered in <a
href="practical.xml">Practical Intro</a></p>

<p>If you enjoy reading long texts, there are also some tips for how
to think about Unix systems in general, and bash scripting in
particular, all found in the <a href="philosophy.xml">Philosophy
Intro</a>.  If you prefer to just get coding straight away, feel free
to skip this for now.  Or forever.  It is non-essential, and my
feelings won't be hurt, I promise.</p>
