<item name="Directories"><p>Your files are organised into directories, as
you are probably used to.  Here, we'll explain briefly how to nagivate
directories in bash.  </p>

<p>There is one directory called "/" that serves as the "root
directory"--that is, every other directory is inside /.  </p>

<p>Whenever you're in the shell, you're always in some directory
somewhere.  This is called the "working directory".  You can find it
with the command 

<code>~/untie$ pwd
/home/potato/untie</code>

This means that in the root directory there is a subdirectory called
"home".  Inside home is a subdir called potato, and inside that is a
subdir called untie, and that is the directory we are currently in.
You can see this for yourself by navigating through all these
directories:  

<code>~/untie$ cd /
/$ ls
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
/$ cd home
/home$ ls
guest  potato
/home$ cd potato
~$ ls
morestuff  stuff  untie
~$ pwd
/home/potato
~$ cd untie
~/untie$ pwd
/home/potato/untie</code>

Here, the commands we're using are:
<ul><li>"cd"--for "change directory", which
changes the working directory</li>
<li>"ls"--for "list", which lists the files in the working
directory</li>
<li>"pwd"--for "print working directory" which prints the path to the
current working directory.  </li>
</ul>

It should be noted that there are three ways of telling cd where to
go: Either we can specify a directory that is inside the current
working directory, as we did with "cd home", or we can specify the
path to the destination directory, starting from the current
directory, as in:

<code>~/untie$ cd /
/$ cd home
/home$ cd potato/untie
~/untie$ pwd
/home/potato/untie</code>

This is called specifying the "relative" path.  Note that you can also
navigate backwards--the folder ".." always refers to one directory
above you (unless you're in /, in which case it refers to /
again--sadly there isn't some secret subbasement in your filesystem).
Thus: 
<code>~/untie$ cd /
/$ cd bin
/bin$ cd ../home/potato/untie
~/untie$ pwd
/home/potato/untie</code>

Or we can specify the honest "absolute" path to the place we want to
go: 
<code>~/untie$ cd /
/$ cd bin
/bin$ cd /home/potato/untie
~/untie$ pwd
/home/potato/untie</code>

<item name="Command prompt">
On the command-line, there is a string displayed to the left of the
current cursor.  In your shell, provided you've set up as we
described, that string will usually look like: [the current working
directory] followed by a $ sign.  When we give code examples, we will
always show the prompt before the code you're supposed to enter, so
that you have some idea of which directory you're supposed to be in
when running that code.  So, for example, when you see 
<code>~/untie/tfp$ echo hello
hello</code>

The first line contains the command prompt.  So before you enter
anything, the shell will look like just: 
<code>~/untie/tfp$ </code>

And you are supposed to enter the text "echo hello" and hit the enter
key.  The next line shows the expected output of this command, namely
"hello".  Some bash commands have no output, in which case another
prompt will simply be displayed after you run it.  For example: 
<code>~/untie$ cd tfp
~/untie/tfp$ x=2
~/untie/tfp$ echo blah
blah
~/untie/tfp$ foo
bash: foo: command not found</code>
</item>

<item name="Tab completion">
<p>Whenever you want to type the name of a command or file, type as much
of it as you need to specify it unambiguously and then hit tab.  If
there is only one command (or file) beginning with the prefix you have
entered thus far, the remainder of that command or filename will be
filled in for you.  If not, hitting tab a second time will bring up a
list of the possible files or commands beginning with that prefix.  </p>
