<h3>Some useful programs</h3>
<p>There are some programs that are very useful on the command line
but are a bit complicated for the quick summary explanation, so here
we provide not a complete tutorial on each of them, but enough
information to enable both basic usage and the derivation of actual
help from the sometimes obscure manpages.</p>

<p>In particular, the goal here is to get you started and then point
you in the direction of resources that can explain the full use of the
program in question.</p>
