<h3>References</h3>
<p>Here we provide references for your basic bash needs.  This does
not claim to be a substitute for the manpages of any programs
discussed, nor a complete treatise on the bash scripting language.
Rather, it should provide you enough information to complete the tasks
and examples set in this tutorial, and enough context that you can
approach the relevant manpages with confidence.</p>
